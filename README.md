# 450-Lab02 Comparing Party Slang Results
## Overview
 In this lab, I decided to analyze the search results for both major political parties through their slang nicknames. Both republicans and democrats had three terms each:
 - Conservative/Liberal
 - Right-wing/Left-wing
 - MAGA/Leftist
 
The goal of these terms is to reference what each party uses as slang for the other party, to see trends in each. I think that this topic is important to understand because of the divide that is being created between political parties, and the harmful narratives from both sides that are being spread. I think this project will help visualize what is being said about each party, and help identify bias coming from both sides. 

## Comparison

Interestingly enough, I think that the differences between these word clouds are large enough that a trend between both is difficult to establish. Search results for democrat slang include results relating to current news events. Charlie Kirk is a notable figure mentioned in this word cloud. Comparing this to the republican slang include several popular social networking apps like Tiktok, Instagram, and Twitch. The slang regarding republicans has a lot of online gen-z slang. This is likely due to the demographics of ages using the slang from each group.

## Considerations
To make this better in the future, I think that a different collection of search terms should be used in order to get this information. The words that I choose resulted in quite a lot of unrelated words that had to be filtered out later, and some results that I struggled to find meaning for. One key thing that is far different than I would have expected is the number of negative words included in each of the word clouds. I think that there is a divide between these two groups spurred along by the current administration, but regardless to see people actively pursuing hate towards an entire group of people based on nothing but their political affiliation is alarming.
